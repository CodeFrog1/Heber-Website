                <p class="History">
                    Before the settlers from Briham Young came to settle Heber Valey 
                    it was first occupied by the Timpanogos Utes.<br> When these Morman 
                    settlers built settlement in the valley the Ute tribe nearest to them
                    started getting into conflict<br> with them because of the hunting grounds
                    they took from them. The settlers built a fort inorder to protect against
                    ute<br> tribe attacks. The was called the Black Hau=wk war and it went on for some time. In 1867 Chief Tabby and his whole<br> band came to Heber City
                    for a peace feast. Large tables were set up in the bowery, and townswomen made
                    a “good picnic”<br> for Tabby and his people. An ox was roasted barbecue style, and
                    everyone filled up on food. The Indians stayed a few days<br> and then went home with
                    presents of food. This picnic created good will, and there were few raids in Wasatch
                    County afterwards.
