                <p class="Index">
                    <br><br>Ever since Heber was founded in July of 1859 
                    new poeple, new buildings, new businesses and new activities
                    have flooded Heber City, up and till today. Here I will 
                    tell you about these things and more including new developments
                    in commerce. 

                    <br><br>In 1850 sawmill workers in Big  cottonwomm Canyon hiked to the summit 
                    of the Wasatch Range and saw Heber Valley. Thus in 1855, a settlement was
                    established directing new immigrants to the new land daily. This settlement 
                    was a mormon community and with some help from the newly arived immigrants 
                    the Provo Canyon Road Company was established, creating a road up Provo Canyon
                    and through what is now the Heber Valley. This road would save immigrants, 
                    traders, and the military time and money. 

                    <br><br>Since 1899 to 1915 the Heber City economy depended on agriculture, livestock, 
                    and dairying. Back then the Rio Grande Western railway track became the shipping
                    center for agricultural products. As Heber grew during 1920 to 1990 local businesses grew
                    such as hotels, retail stores, markets, lumberyards, banks, and even non-local businesses
                    such as restaurant chains. 

                    <br><br>New activities in Heber ever since the 1990s include riding the Heber Valley 
                    railroad all the up to provo while listening to country music and learning
                    about Heber Valley history and legends. You can also hike the Unita National 
                    Forest with its breathtaking geography and views draw in people from all ages
                    who mountain bike, ski, hike and camp. You can visit Deer Creek State Park with
                    its exapnisve lake with many oportunities for fishing, swimming, boating and kayak.
                    You can also visit the CAF Utah Wing Museum in Heber and see there many collections
                    of airplanes over the decades as well as their history and use in those eras.
